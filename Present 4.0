Got it! Let's focus on what makes the code great and categorize its main strengths, while keeping the quality of life features in a separate section. Here’s a refined structure:

---

### **Slide 1: Core Functional Features**
1. **Parallel File Copying**: 
   - Uses multithreading to copy files in parallel based on CPU resources, significantly speeding up the file transfer process.
   
2. **Parallel Excel File Processing**:
   - Multiple Excel files are processed concurrently using `joblib.Parallel`, utilizing available CPU cores to handle large datasets efficiently.

3. **Excel Search Functionality**:
   - The script searches for specific terms across multiple Excel sheets within each file, processing large volumes of data to find relevant matches.

---

### **Slide 2: Enhanced Data Handling & Search**
1. **Optimized Row Searching with `.apply()`**:
   - The `.apply()` function in Pandas vectorizes the search logic, making row-by-row searching faster and more efficient.
   
2. **Search Terms Flexibility**:
   - Only non-empty fields from the user input are used as search terms, ensuring that the search process focuses on relevant terms and avoids unnecessary checks.

3. **Folder Search**:
   - In addition to searching Excel files, the script also searches through folder names in a directory, expanding its functionality beyond just file content searches.

---

### **Slide 3: Output and Reporting Features**
1. **Formatted Excel Output**:
   - Search results are written into an Excel file with professional formatting, including color-coded cells, borders, and merged headers, making it easy for users to interpret results.
   
2. **Search Term Highlighting**:
   - Matched search terms are highlighted in the Excel output, allowing users to quickly identify relevant information.

3. **Excel Header Freezing**:
   - The headers and search terms in the output file are frozen, making it easier to scroll through large datasets while keeping important information visible.

---

### **Slide 4: Performance Enhancements**
1. **Dynamic Thread Allocation**:
   - Both file copying and Excel searching dynamically adjust the number of threads based on available CPU resources, optimizing performance and avoiding system overload.
   
2. **Efficient Search Logic**:
   - The script’s use of `.apply()` for search operations and dynamic thread allocation reduces processing time, even for large datasets and files.

3. **Logging for Error Handling**:
   - The script logs errors in a dedicated log file, making troubleshooting easier and ensuring that the process remains stable during execution.

---

### **Slide 5: Quality of Life Features**
1. **User-Friendly Search Terms UI**:
   - An intuitive GUI allows users to easily input search terms (e.g., first name, last name, ID), with real-time input validation and common keyboard shortcuts like `Enter` for submission and `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y` for undo/redo.

2. **Real-Time Input Capitalization**:
   - Automatically capitalizes first and last names as users type, ensuring consistent input formatting.

3. **Undo/Redo and Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - The interface supports undo and redo functionality with `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y`, along with keyboard shortcuts that improve user interaction.

---

### **Slide 6: Overall Impact on Performance**
1. **Improved Efficiency**:
   - By leveraging parallelism in both file copying and search operations, the code significantly reduces overall processing time, especially for large datasets.
   
2. **Scalable Across Systems**:
   - The dynamic adjustment of threads based on CPU capacity ensures the code can scale efficiently on different systems, from standard laptops to high-performance machines.

3. **Optimized Data Processing**:
   - Efficient use of Pandas functions (`.apply()`), streamlined search logic, and file handling ensures that the code runs quickly, even when handling thousands of rows and multiple files.

This structure keeps the focus on what makes the code great—efficient data processing, parallelization, and high performance—while also highlighting its user-friendly aspects. By separating the **core functionality**, **performance enhancements**, and **quality of life** features, you can present the value and impact of the code more clearly.
