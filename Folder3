    Search for folders based on first and last name in a directory with recursive search limited to 3 levels deep.
    Skips symbolic links to avoid infinite loops.
    
    Parameters:
    - directory: Base directory to search within.
    - first_name: First name to search for.
    - last_name: Last name to search for.
    - max_depth: Maximum depth for recursive search (default is 3).
